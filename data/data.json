      "abstract": "Even if an explosive number of proposals and prototype systems of blockchain based certificates and verification have been suggested and implemented since 2015, still in the public service areas paper certificates are prevalent.  Because of advancement of color duplication and editing tools obtainable at almost no price in the internet, paper certificates are easily forged and modified. For the reason, the verification technology of the paper certificates needs need regressive research and can provide abundant research opportunities. In this research, various research suggestions and technical implementation are reviewed and a new system, called ‘one-shot’ verification is briefly described. The one-shot verification captures the image and QR code of the printed certificates with mobile devices before sending them to block-chained server. The block-chained server decides whether the printed certificates are tampered or not, with the OCR content by comparing hash value with hash value of the original content. The image OCR of the paper was trained with more than 1,700 images using YOLOv8. In the testing with preprocessing, the technology showed 96% accuracy.",
